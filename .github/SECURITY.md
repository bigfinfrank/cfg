# Security Policy
*Security Policy revision 1.0.0 last updated November 27th 2021*

I take  privacy and security extremely seriously. I run this config personally so of course this has been a top priority for me since before this was even a config and it was just console commands I'd run periodically.
With that said, I want to give people a way to communicate issues to me in a professional manor, and if I think it's reasonable I may offer to credit you in the README.

## My approach to security issues
- I will not take action against those disclosing issues¹
- Even inaccurate or invalid² issues will be responded to as fast as possible. First with acknowledgement then with investigation and (if applicable) resolution.
- I will (to the best of my ability) share safe information³ with you on how and when the issue will be resolved.
- Dependant on how severe the issue was and other factors, I may choose to reward you for reporting the vulnerability. For example, I might credit you in the project's README.

*¹Assuming that the issue was disclosed without malicious intent or previous malicious use by said discloser*
*²Invalid issues are issues that I have deemed to not be issues. An example of this would be if someone thought something intentional was a security issue.*
*³Safe information is information that at the current time I do not consider too private or detremental to avoid revealing. An example of **un**safe information would be a password.*


## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report vulnerabilities to cfgsecurity@fin.fail, just make sure you follow and agree to these guidelines:
1. Your email should not contain details about the vulnerability or what it affects in the subject, only in the content of the email itself.
2. Please replace any personally sensitive details or information about you or anyone else with `[redacted]`.
3. Do not disclose the vulnerability itself to anyone, even project collaborators. You should only use the above email to communicate about these.
4. Do not tell anyone that you have found or disclosed a vulnerability in any way.
5. If you do not specify whether you would like to be credited with discovering this vulnerability, I will assume you'd like to be kept anonymous.
6. I may publicly disclose any vulnerabilities in any form I would like. This includes complete disclosure or partial. (While respecting privacy and anonymity if applicable).
7. The only versions relevant to me are the latest releases per game, pre-releases per game, and the most recent unpublished repository code per game. 


## Non-vulnerabilities
There are some things that while they could be considered vulnerabilities, they are not applicable to this project and are potentially unavoidable. A rough (incomplete) list goes as follows:
- Denial of Service attacks or bruteforce-style attacks that are made more effective by settings in this config (such as increased networking rate)
- Vulnerabilities that are caused by a third party (for example, a bug with CSGO that Valve needs to fix).
- Vulnerabilities requiring the user to utilize a modded version of CSGO or automation in some form (ex. Noble Strike or Scripting).
- Targetted attacks (for example, an attack that involves first gaining access to a conttributor's computer)
- Attacks involving literal fraud (for example, sim-swapping to bypass GitHub 2FA or impersonating contributors while contacting a cloud backup provider)
